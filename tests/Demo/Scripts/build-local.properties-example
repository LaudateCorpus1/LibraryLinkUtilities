# Copy this file to build-local.properties to customize your development build.

# You must have AntCCompilerBuildHelper, found in CVS in Mathematica/AddOns.

# CompilerIncludes is a path to a directory holding WolframLibrary.h (defaults to a location from the Mathematica layout)
# MathLink is a path to a directory holding a MathLink SDK; namely, it should have a CompilerAdditions subdirectory (defaults to a location from the Mathematica layout)
# targetID is the $SystemID of the target you want to build (defaults to $SystemID)
# system_id is also the $SystemID of the target you want to build (defaults to $SystemID)
# mathematicaInstallDir is the location of the Mathematica installation you want to run the build script
# mathExe is the location of the kernel you want to run the build script
# build_platform is the RE code for the compiler that should be used (things like centos5-gcc4.4 and vc100)
# dist is the location of the build output
# build_platform has values like vc100 on Windows, centos5-gcc4.4 on Linux, and snowleopard-gcc4.2 on Mac. Check the RE build system for what values are actually being passed in.
